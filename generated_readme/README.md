## Description 

This is a command-line application that will enable users to quickly generate a README by answering the questions presented to them. The application uses the inquirer package for the command-line interface and creates a README file in the generated_readme folder that abides to the Markdown syntax in [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). In fact this README is also generated by this app.
